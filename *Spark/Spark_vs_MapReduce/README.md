# Spark vs MapReduce 

https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/spark-vs-hadoop-mapreduce

Spark can do it in-memory, while Hadoop MapReduce has to read from and write to a disk. As a result, the speed of processing differs significantly â€“ Spark may be up to 100 times faster. However, the volume of data processed also differs: Hadoop MapReduce is able to work with far larger data sets than Spark.
