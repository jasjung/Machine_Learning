# SSH and Github

Sometimes you have to use SSH instead of HTTPS for your git remote setup. 


### Change setting from HTTPS to SSH 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14762034/push-to-github-without-a-password-using-ssh-key

```sh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git
```

If you have upstream, might need to remove it and add it again.

```sh
# to see if you have upstream 
git remote -v
# remove 
git remote rm upstream
# add 
git remote add upstream git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git
```

#   UseKeychain yes
#   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
