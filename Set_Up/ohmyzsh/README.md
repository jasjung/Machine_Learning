"ZSH, also called the Z shell, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since itâ€™s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze."

When I swtiched to zsh, it had trouble accessing jupyter notebook. FYI, my jupyter was installed via conda. This is what I did the fix: 

1. copy some files from bash_profile 

	```sh 
	cat ~/.bash_profile
	```

	Where you see something like the following 

	```sh 
	alias jp='jupyter notebook'
	# added by Anaconda3 5.0.1 installer
	export PATH="/Users/ijung/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
	```

2. Copy them and them at the end of `vi ~/.zshrc` file. 
3. Run `source ~/.zshrc` command. 
4. It worked!

It base show `base` in your terminal. to hide: 
```conda config --set changeps1 False```
