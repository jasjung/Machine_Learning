# Naming Convention

why is class starting with `com`? 

```
Package names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.

Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package namesâ€”for example, com.example.mypackage for a package named mypackage created by a programmer at example.com.
```
