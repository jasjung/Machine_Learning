# final variable

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/final-keyword-java/

- When a variable is declared with final keyword, its value canâ€™t be modified, essentially, a constant.
- It is good practice to represent final variables in all uppercase, using underscore to separate words.


```java 
// a final variable
final int THRESHOLD = 5;
```
